# IDCamp Data Scientist Project - Exploration Data Analysis of ECommerce Public Dataset. 
This project is part of my data scientist learning path in IDCamp.

## Project Goal
This project goal is to do Data Exploration Analysis of E-Commerce Public Sales dataset and get some insight from the sales in this E-Commerce that can help to create company decision.

There are some questions that I want to answer in this project:
1. How did the company's sales and revenue perform over the past few months?
2. Which product that sold the most and the least?
3. Which seller sold the most?
4. How's the demographics of the customers?
5. When was the last time a customer made a transaction?
6. How often did a customer make a purchase?
7. How much money have customers spent?
