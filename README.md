# IDCamp_DataAnalysisProject
Exploration Data Analysis of E-Commerce Public Dataset. 
This project is part of my data scientist learning path in IDCamp.

## Project Goal
This project goal is to do Data Exploration Analysis of E-Commerce Public Sales dataset and get some insight from the sales in this E-Commerce that can help to create company decision.

There are some questions that I want to answer in this project:

2. Which product that sold the most and the least?
3. Which seller sold the most?
4. How's the demographics of the customers?
5. When was the last time a customer made a transaction?
6. How often did a customer make a purchase?
7. How much money have customers spent?
